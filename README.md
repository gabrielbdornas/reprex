```
# run an alert
alert('hello'); # this are code

alert('hello') # after enter enter the computer runs the code.

# to do math
2+2
10-3

# change the page's content
# modify the webpage
document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';

# Syntax are rule that we have to follow.
# Natural language could be understood with syntaxe errors, but in programming language no
```

```
# Multiplication
10*3

# Division
10/2

# syntaxe is just type numbers and operators like regular math operations

# Decimal numbers
4.4

# Order of operations
# numbers
# operators (-, +, /, *)
# operators precedance
# brackets could change this order
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations
(1+1)*3 # 1+1 will be done first
# take care of syntaxe errors.
# Multiplication done first here
20.95 + 7.99 * 2 + 18.99 * 3

# Number types
typeof(2.0)
number
typeof(1)
number # why?
# computers can story floats properly - why?
# money could not have acurrace problems.
# calculate in cents instead of dolars
20.95 + 7.99
28.939999999999998
(2095 + 799)/100
28.94
